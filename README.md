= Typhon

  Typhon is a python implementation for the Rubinius VM.

= Requirements
  
  - python 2
  - rubinius head
  - rake

= Status

  Im in search of a nice python parser that can be implemented
  in ruby or used as a c-extension. Right now, we use a simple
  python script that outputs a program AST using ruby literals
  then feed that to the typhon compiler to produce rubinius asm

= About Typhon

  The name was choosen as a funny anagram of 'Python'.

  Also Typhon seems to be a weird looking creature:
